Playing KanColle on the iOS is not easy.
KanColle player data on the Android 3rd party browsers cannot sync with desktop platform browsers.
And there is no one software to play KanColle on mobile platform and desktop platform.

This project goal is use same UI and be able to synchronize player data on all platforms.
